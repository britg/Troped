# Troped

A Rogue-light + Deck Builder.

Influences: Rogue Legacy, Hoplite, Hearthstone

An adventuring party discovers a dark tower in a distant land. Within the tower was a massive treasure chest, obviously a trap of some sort. The party's thief attempts to detect and disarm the trap, but unfortunately she triggers it. The party, consisting of a Warrior, Thief and Mage, are magically bound together by some sort of magical rope. The chest lowers into the ground through some mechanical trap door.

Four doors appear along the walls of this floor of the tower, all leading to stairs. Three of the doors are locked, each marked with a symbol: fire, ice and poison. The only passage available to the now joined party leads up into darkness.
